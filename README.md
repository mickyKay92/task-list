## Task List App

**Project Type:** Coursework

**Course Title:** 'Modern JavaScript From The Beginning' by Brad Traversy

**Description:**
This was the first project in the vanilla JavaScript Udemy course I was studying. It implements all that I had learned to this point including creating and appending DOM elements, using event listeners and storing data into the localstorage.

Please note that I created this app by following step-by-step instructions from the instructor.
